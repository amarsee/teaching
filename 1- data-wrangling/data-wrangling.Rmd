## The `tidyverse`

The `tidyverse` is a set of packages which covers most steps of the data science process (importing, wrangling, visualization).

![](images/tidyverse.png)

> * Built around the concept of a **tidy** data frame
> * Work nicely with the **pipe** `%>%`

## Obtaining the `tidyverse`

Install the `tidyverse` packages and dependencies:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

&nbsp;

. . .

Import the core `tidyverse` packages into your R session:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Reading in data

Use `readr::read_csv()` to import a .csv file:

``` {r}
districts <- read_csv("data/districts.csv")
```

## Our data

For each of 145 school districts and the State, the `districts` data contains:

* Proficiency rates on state tests
* Student demographics
* Chronic absenteeism
* Discipline (suspension, expulsion) rates
* High school graduation, dropout rates
* Average ACT composite scores
* Student demograpics
* A region in Tennessee

for the 2014-15 school year.

## Looking at data

Use `View()` to look at a data frame:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
View(districts)
```

## An overview of a data frame

Use `summary()` to get an overview of a data frame:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(districts)
```

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(districts)
```

## An overview of a data frame

Use `tibble::glimpse()` to get an overview of a data frame:

```{r}
glimpse(districts)
```

## `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Your two-stop shop for data wrangling:

. . .

![](images/dplyr.png) 

`dplyr`: pliers, for data frames

## `dplyr`

Five main functions for manipulating data frames:

* `select()` - Keeping/dropping columns
* `filter()` - Keeping/dropping observations
* `mutate()` - Creating/modifying columns
* `arrange()` - Sorting by column values
* `summarise()` - Collapsing into summary statistics

## Keeping/dropping columns

Keep columns with `select()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
select(districts, system, system_name)
```

. . .

The first argument to `select()` is a data frame, and the second is the column(s) you want to keep, separated by commas.

## Keeping/dropping columns

Keep columns with `select()`:

``` {r}
select(districts, system, system_name)
```

## Keeping/dropping columns

Drop columns with `select()` using `-` before a column name:

``` {r}
select(districts, -system)
```

## Ways to specify columns with `select()`

> * Unquoted names - `select(df, x, y, z)`
> * A range of columns positionally - `select(df, x:z)`

. . .

* Using `dplyr` helper functions, including:
    * `starts_with()`
    * `ends_with()`
    * `contains()`
    * `one_of()` if you need to specify columns as a string
    * `everything()`

## Reordering columns

Reorder columns with `select()` by listing columns in the order you want:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
select(districts, system, system_name, region, everything())
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
select(districts, system, system_name, region, everything())
```

## Keeping/dropping observations

Keep observations with `filter()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
filter(districts, system_name == "State of Tennessee")
```

. . .

The first argument to `filter()` is a data frame, and the second is a logical condition describing the observations you want to keep.

## Keeping/dropping observations

Keep observations with `filter()`:

``` {r}
filter(districts, system_name == "State of Tennessee")
```

## Keeping/dropping observations

Drop observations with `filter()` by negating a logical condition:

``` {r}
filter(districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee")
```

## Exercise 1

Use `filter()` to identify districts with 100% Algebra I proficiency.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
filter(districts, alg_1 == 100)
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
filter(districts, alg_1 == 100)
```

## Creating new columns

Create new columns with `mutate()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts, 
    bhn = black + hispanic + native)
```

. . .

The first argument to `mutate()` is a data frame, and the second is a new column name followed by `=` and an expression for calculating that column.

## Modifying columns

The syntax for modifying columns with `mutate()` is the same as for creating columns:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts, enrollment = enrollment/1000)
```

## Creating/modifying columns

Create and/or modify arbitrarily many columns with `mutate()`; separate expressions with a comma:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    enrollment = enrollment/1000,
    expenditures = expenditures/1000
)
```

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

Use `if_else()` if you want a column to take different values under different conditions:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", "Small"))
```

&nbsp;

> * The first argument to `if_else()` is a logical condition.
> * The second is the value of the new column if the logical condition is `TRUE`.
> * The third is the value of the column if the logical condition is `FALSE`.
> * If the logical condition returns `NA`, the value of the column will be `NA`.

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

Use `if_else()` if you want a column to take different values under different conditions:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", "Small"))
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>% 
    mutate(district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", "Small")) %>%
    select(system_name, enrollment, district_size)
```

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

Use multiple `if_else()` statements in succession if you have multiple conditions:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", NA_character_),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 5000 & enrollment < 10000, 
        "Medium", district_size),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment < 5000, "Small", district_size)
)
```

. . .

The first `if_else()` assigns `"Large"` to `district_size` if `enrollment` is greater or equal to 10000, and `NA` (of the character variety) otherwise.

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

Use multiple `if_else()` statements in succession if you have multiple conditions:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", NA_character_),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 5000 & enrollment < 10000, 
        "Medium", district_size),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment < 5000, "Small", district_size)
)
```

The second `if_else()` assigns `"Medium"` to `district_size` if `enrollment` is between 5000 and 10000, and leaves `district_size` the same otherwise.

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

Use multiple `if_else()` statements in succession if you have multiple conditions:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", NA_character_),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 5000 & enrollment < 10000,
        "Medium", district_size),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment < 5000, "Small", district_size)
)
```

The third `if_else()` assigns `"Small"` to `district_size` if `enrollment` is less than 5000, and leaves `district_size` the same otherwise.

## `if_else()` with `mutate()`

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", NA_character_),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 5000 & enrollment < 10000,
        "Medium", district_size),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment < 5000, "Small", district_size)
)
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 10000, "Large", NA_character_),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment >= 5000 & enrollment < 10000,
        "Medium", district_size),
    district_size = if_else(enrollment < 5000, "Small", district_size)
) %>%
    select(system_name, enrollment, district_size)
```

## `case_when()` with `mutate()`

With many conditions, it's better to use `case_when()` than several `if_else()` statements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = case_when(
        enrollment >= 10000 ~ "Large",
        enrollment >= 5000 ~ "Medium",
        enrollment < 5000 ~ "Small"
    )
)
```

. . .

`case_when()` takes a sequence of two-sided formulas, where the left side of each formula is a logical condition, and the right side is the value of a column if the logical condition is `TRUE`.

## `case_when()` with `mutate()`

With many conditions, it's better to use `case_when()` than several `if_else()` statements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    district_size = case_when(
        enrollment >= 10000 ~ "Large",
        enrollment >= 5000 ~ "Medium",
        enrollment < 5000 ~ "Small"
    )
)
```

Each logical condition is evaluated as IF (condition) AND NOT (any previous condition), so consider this when specifying/ordering your formulas.

## Exercise 2

Create a new column called `math_achievement` with a value of:
    
* `"High"` if a district's Math proficiency is 75% or higher;
* `"Medium"` if a district's Math proficiency is between 50% and 75%;
* `"Low"` if a district's Math proficiency is below 50%.

&nbsp;

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts,
    math_achievement = if_else(math >= 75, "High", NA_character_),
    math_achievement = if_else(math >= 50 & math < 75, "Medium", math_achievement),
    math_achievement = if_else(math < 50, "Low", math_achievement)
)
```

## Exercise 2

Create a new column called `math_achievement` with a value of:
    
* `"High"` if a district's Math proficiency is 75% or higher;
* `"Medium"` if a district's Math proficiency is between 50% and 75%;
* `"Low"` if a district's Math proficiency is below 50%.

&nbsp;

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(districts, 
    math_achievement = case_when(
        math >= 75 ~ "High",
        math >= 50 ~ "Medium",
        math < 50 ~ "Low"
    )
)
```

## Exercise 2

Create a new column called `math_achievement` with a value of:
    
* `"High"` if a district's Math proficiency is 75% or higher;
* `"Medium"` if a district's Math proficiency is between 50% and 75%;
* `"Low"` if a district's Math proficiency is below 50%.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
mutate(districts, math_achievement = case_when(
    math >= 75 ~ "High",
    math >= 50 ~ "Medium",
    math < 50 ~ "Low")
) %>%
select(system_name, math, math_achievement)
```

## The pipe operator (`%>%`)

Often, you will want to do several data manipulations in succession. This can be a hassle if you have to nest a bunch of function calls:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(
    select(
        filter(
            districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee"
        ),
    system_name, enrollment:expenditures),
enrollment = log10(enrollment)
)
```

. . .

Or assign each intermediate step to a object:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts2 <- filter(districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee")
districts3 <- select(districts2, 
    system_name, enrollment:expenditures)
districts4 <- mutate(districts3, enrollment = log10(enrollment))
```

## The pipe operator (`%>%`)

The pipe operator (`%>%`) provides a better alternative. It passes the result of one function as an argument to another function (the first argument, by default).

. . .

The first argument of all `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions is the data frame you want to manipulate, so piping makes for more readable code:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    select(system_name, enrollment:expenditures) %>%
    mutate(enrollment = log10(enrollment))
```

## Exercise 3

Filter down to district 792 (Shelby County), then pipe the result to `View()`.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system == 792) %>%
    View()
```

## Renaming columns

Rename columns with `rename()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
rename(districts, district = system)
```

. . .

The first argument to `rename()` is a data frame, followed by pairs of names with the pattern `new_name = old_name`.

## Renaming columns

Rename columns with `rename()`:

``` {r}
rename(districts, district = system)
```

## Renaming columns

Column names can contain spaces and other characters. Put backticks (``) around a name if it contains spaces.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
rename(districts,
    district = system, 
    `district name` = system_name
)
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
rename(districts,
    district = system, 
    `district name` = system_name
)
```

## Exercise 4

Do the following in one sequence of function calls, piped together:

1. Read in the `data/tvaas.csv` file.
2. Rename columns as follows:
    * `District Number` to `system`.
    * `Composite` to `TVAAS Composite`.
    * `Literacy` to `TVAAS Literacy`.
    * `Numeracy` to `TVAAS Numeracy`.
3. Drop the `District Name` column.

Assign the name `tvaas` to the result.

## Exercise 4

``` {r}
tvaas <- read_csv("data/tvaas.csv") %>%
    rename(
        system = `District Number`,
        `TVAAS Composite` = `Composite`,
        `TVAAS Literacy` = `Literacy`,
        `TVAAS Numeracy` = `Numeracy`
    ) %>%
    select(-`District Name`)
```

## Sorting a data frame

Sort a data frame with `arrange()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(districts, system_name)
```

The first argument to `arrange()` is a data frame, and the second is the column(s) you want to sort on.

## Sorting a data frame

Sort a data frame with `arrange()`:

``` {r}
arrange(districts, system_name)
```

## Sorting a data frame

`arrange()` sorts numeric columns in ascending order and string columns alphabetically; reverse this with `desc(var_name)`.

``` {r}
arrange(districts, desc(system_name))
```

## Exercise 5

Sort `districts` alphabetically by region, then by Algebra I proficiency in descending order. Then, keep the district name, Algebra I proficiency, and region columns.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    arrange(region, desc(alg_1)) %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, region)
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    arrange(region, desc(alg_1)) %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, region)
```

## Collapsing a data frame

Collapse a data frame into summary statistics with `summarise()`:

``` {r}
districts %>%
    summarise(
        mean(math, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean(ela, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

. . .

The first argument is a data frame, and the second is any summary statistic(s) you want to compute, separated by commas.

## Collapsing a data frame

Collapse a data frame into summary statistics with `summarise()`:

``` {r}
districts %>%
    summarise(
        mean_math = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean_ela = mean(ela, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

You can also supply column names to the resulting data frame.

## Exercise 6

Use `summarise()` to find the mean, minimum, and maximum district grad rate. Assign column names to the resulting data frame.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    summarise(
        mean_grad = mean(grad, na.rm = TRUE),
        min_grad = min(grad, na.rm = TRUE),
        max_grad = max(grad, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    summarise(
        mean_grad = mean(grad, na.rm = TRUE),
        min_grad = min(grad, na.rm = TRUE),
        max_grad = max(grad, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

## Collapsing a data frame

Use `group_by()` with `summarise()` to aggregate data to a higher unit of analysis (e.g.: student to school level; school to district level):

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(
        math = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE), 
        ela = mean(ela, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

. . .

&nbsp;

* The argument to `group_by()` is the column(s) that define your groups.

## Collapsing a data frame

Use `group_by()` with `summarise()` to aggregate data to a higher unit of analysis (e.g.: student to school level; school to district level):

``` {r}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(
        math = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE), 
        ela = mean(ela, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

## Collapsing a data frame

After doing operations with `group_by()`, be sure to `ungroup()` your data frame.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(
        math = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE), 
        ela = mean(ela, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    ungroup()
```

. . .

`group_by()` affects all `dplyr` functions, e.g.:

* `select()` doesn't drop grouping columns.
* `arrange()` sorts on grouping columns first.

## Add summary statistics to a data frame

Instead of collapsing, you might want to add summary statistics as columns to a data frame.

. . .

Do this with `mutate()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    mutate(math_mean = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE))
```

. . .

This calculates the mean of Math %P/A, and creates a column `Math_mean` with that value across all observations.

## Add summary statistics to a data frame

Instead of collapsing, you might want to add summary statistics as columns to a data frame.

Do this with `mutate()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    mutate(math_mean = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE))
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    mutate(math_mean = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(system_name, math, math_mean)
```

## Exercise 7

Identify districts with a higher Percent ED than the median district, and a higher Math proficiency than the median district.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    mutate(
        median_pct_ed = median(ed, na.rm = TRUE),
        median_math = median(math, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    filter(ed > median_pct_ed & math > median_math) %>%
    select(system_name, math, median_math)
```

## Exercise 7

Identify districts with a higher Percent ED than the median district, and a higher Math proficiency than the median district.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    filter(system_name != "State of Tennessee") %>%
    mutate(
        median_pct_ed = median(ed, na.rm = TRUE),
        median_math = median(math, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    filter(ed > median_pct_ed & math > median_math) %>%
    select(system_name, math, median_math)
```

## Add summary statistics to a data frame

Use `group_by()` to calculate summary statistics by group:

``` {r}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    mutate(math_mean = mean(math, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(system_name, region, math, math_mean)
```

## Exercise 8

Identify districts with a higher dropout rate than the average of districts in the same region.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    mutate(dropout_mean = mean(dropout, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    filter(dropout > dropout_mean) %>%
    select(system_name, region, dropout, dropout_mean)
```

## Exercise 8

Identify districts with a higher dropout rate than the average of districts in the same region.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    mutate(dropout_mean = mean(dropout, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    filter(dropout > dropout_mean) %>%
    select(system_name, region, dropout, dropout_mean)
```

## Operations by row

Suppose you want the average of a district's Algebra I and Algebra II proficiency rates.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, alg_2)
```

## Operations by row

You might do the following:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, alg_2) %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = (alg_I + alg_II)/2)
```

. . .

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, alg_2) %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = (alg_1 + alg_2)/2)
```

## Operations by row

However, this breaks down when either `alg_1` or `alg_2` is missing.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, alg_2) %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = (alg_1 + alg_2)/2) %>%
    filter(xor(is.na(alg_1), is.na(alg_2)))
```

## Operations by row

The solution is to use `rowwise()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = mean(c(alg_1, alg_2), na.rm = TRUE))
```

. . .

Similar to `group_by()`, `rowwise()` tells `dplyr` verbs to do calculations within rows.

## Operations by row

The solution is to use `rowwise()`:

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    select(system_name, alg_1, alg_2) %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = mean(c(alg_1, alg_2), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    filter(xor(is.na(alg_1), is.na(alg_2)))
```

## Operations by row

Similar to `group_by()`, you should apply `ungroup()` after doing operations by row.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(alg_mean = mean(c(alg_1, alg_2), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup()
```

## Exercise 9

Create three columns: 

* A district's average proficiency in math subjects (Math, Algebra I-II)
* A district's average proficiency in English subjects (ELA, English I-III)
* A district's average proficiency in science subjects (Science, Biology, Chemistry)

Then, reorder columns such that:

* The math average is next to the individual math columns.
* The English average is next to the individual English columns.
* The science average is next to the individual science columns.

## Exercise 9

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(
        math_mean = mean(c(math, alg_1, alg_2), na.rm = TRUE),
        eng_mean = mean(c(ela, eng_1, eng_2, eng_3), na.rm = TRUE),
        sci_mean = mean(c(science, bio, chem), na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(system, system_name, math, alg_1, alg_2, math_mean,
        ela, eng_1, eng_2, eng_3, eng_mean, science, bio, chem, sci_mean)
```

## Exercise 9

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(
        math_mean = mean(c(math, alg_1, alg_2), na.rm = TRUE),
        eng_mean = mean(c(ela, eng_1, eng_2, eng_3), na.rm = TRUE),
        sci_mean = mean(c(science, bio, chem), na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(system, system_name, math, alg_1, alg_2, math_mean,
        ela, eng_1, eng_2, eng_3, eng_mean, science, bio, chem, sci_mean)
```

## Combining data frames

When combining data frames, you're doing one of two things:

* Adding observations on the same columns
* Adding columns on the same units

## Combining data frames

Add observations on the same columns with `bind_rows()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
state <- filter(districts, system_name == "State of Tennessee")
districts <- filter(districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee")

bind_rows(state, districts)
```

. . .

The argument to `bind_rows()` is the data frames you want to combine, separated by commas.

## Combining data frames

Add observations on the same columns with `bind_rows()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
state <- filter(districts, system_name == "State of Tennessee")
districts <- filter(districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee")

bind_rows(state, districts)
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
state <- filter(districts, system_name == "State of Tennessee")
districts <- filter(districts, system_name != "State of Tennessee")

bind_rows(state, districts)
```

## Combining data frames

Add columns on the same units with a **join**. 

. . .

A join requires a **key**, one or more columns matching observations in one data frame to those in the second.

. . .

A key should uniquely identify observations in one or both of your data frames.

## Combining data frames

We will join the `districts` and `tvaas` data frames using `system` as a key.

. . .

A numeric id key is generally better than a name, because names might be slightly discrepant (e.g.: spelling, capitalization).

## Combining data frames

There are five types of joins:

> * `inner_join()` keeps only matched observations.
> * `left_join()` drops unmatched observations in the second data frame.
> * `right_join()` drops unmatched observations in the first data frame.
> * `full_join()` keeps all observations.
> * `anti_join()` keeps only unmatched observations in the first data frame.

. . .

`districts` has achievement and profile data for all districts and the state. `tvaas` has TVAAS data for all districts.

. . .

Q: What happens if we `inner_join()` the `districts` and `tvaas` data frames?

## Combining data frames

* `inner_join()` keeps only matched observations.

* `anti_join()` keeps only unmatched observations in the first data frame.

Q: What happens if we `anti_join()` the `districts` and `tvaas` data frames?

## Combining data frames

We will join the `districts` and `tvaas` data frames using `system` as a key.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
full_join(districts, tvaas, by = "system")
```

The first two arguments to any `join` function are two data frames, and the third is the key column(s).

## Combining data frames

We will join the `districts` and `tvaas` data frames using `system` as a key.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
full_join(districts, tvaas, by = "system")
```

## Combining data frames

When joining on multiple key columns, specify them as a character vector:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
full_join(df1, df2, by = c("key_var1", "key_var2"))
```

## Combining data frames

Key column names don't have to match between the two data frames:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
full_join(df1, df2, by = c("x1" = "x2", "y1" = "y2", "z1" = "z2"))
```

This will join `df1` and `df2` by matching values of `x1` in `df1` with values of `x2` in `df2`, `y1` with `y2`, and `z1` with `z2`.

## Exercise 10

Create a data frame with the number of districts at each TVAAS Composite level, by region.

. . .

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
districts %>%
    inner_join(tvaas, by = "system") %>%
    mutate(
        Level1 = if_else(`TVAAS Composite` == 1, 1, 0),
        Level2 = if_else(`TVAAS Composite` == 2, 1, 0),
        Level3 = if_else(`TVAAS Composite` == 3, 1, 0),
        Level4 = if_else(`TVAAS Composite` == 4, 1, 0),
        Level5 = if_else(`TVAAS Composite` == 5, 1, 0)
    ) %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(
        Level1 = sum(Level1, na.rm = TRUE),
        Level2 = sum(Level2, na.rm = TRUE),
        Level3 = sum(Level3, na.rm = TRUE),
        Level4 = sum(Level4, na.rm = TRUE),
        Level5 = sum(Level5, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    ungroup()
```

        Level5 = sum(Level5, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%

        Level4 = sum(Level4, na.rm = TRUE),
        Level5 = sum(Level5, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    ungroup()
```

## Exercise 10

More succinctly:

``` {r}
districts %>%
    inner_join(tvaas, by = "system") %>%
    count(region, `TVAAS Composite`)
```

## `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Your two-stop shop for data wrangling:

![](images/dplyr.png) 

`dplyr`: pliers, for data frames

. . .

![](images/tidyr.png)

`tidyr`: for reshaping data frames

## Some terminology

A data frame is **wide** by a variable if values of that variable are spread across **columns**.

. . .

A data frame is **long** by a variable if values of that variable are spread across **rows**.

## Some terminology

Q: What is the `districts` data frame wide by? Long by?

![](images/viewer.png)

## Reshaping data frames

`tidyr` has two functions for reshaping:

* `pivot_longer()` converts a data frame from wide to long.
* `pivot_wider()` converts a data frame from long to wide.

## Reshaping data frames

Suppose I want to reshape this data frame long by subject/characteristic.

![](images/viewer.png)

## Reshaping data frames

This creates a new variable with `"alg_1"`, `"alg_2"`, ..., `"dropout"`, and a new column with the appropriate value for each district.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    pivot_longer(alg_1:dropout, names_to =  'outcome', 
                 values_to = 'value') %>%
    select(system, system_name, outcome, value)
```

## Reshaping data frames

`pivot_longer()` converts a data frame from wide to long:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
pivot_longer(districts, alg_1:dropout, 
             names_to = 'outcome', values_to = 'value')
```

> * The first argument to `pivot_longer()` is a data frame.
> * The second is the columns you want to convert to a column.
> * The third is the name of a new variable which will take the values of your column names.
> * The fourth is the name of a new variable which will take the values of the data in your columns.


## Reshaping data frames

`pivot_longer()` converts a data frame from wide to long:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
pivot_longer(districts, alg_1:dropout, 
             names_to = outcome, values_to = valuet)
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    pivot_longer(alg_1:dropout, names_to =  'outcome', 
                 values_to = 'value') %>%
    select(system, system_name, outcome, value, region)
```

## Reshaping data frames

`pivot_wider()` converts a data frame from long to wide:

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
districts %>%
    pivot_longer(alg_1:dropout, names_to =  'outcome', 
                 values_to = 'value') %>%
    select(system, system_name, outcome, value, region)
```

. . .

Suppose I want to reshape this data frame wide by district.

## Reshaping data frames

First, I'll save the long version of this data frame as an R object.

``` {r}
districts_long <- districts %>%
    pivot_longer(alg_1:dropout, names_to =  'outcome', 
                 values_to = 'value') %>%
    select(system_name, outcome, value)
```

## Reshaping data frames

`pivot_wider()` converts a data frame from long to wide:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
pivot_wider(districts_long, names_from = 'system_name', 
            values_from = 'value')
```

> * The first argument to `pivot_wider()` is a data frame.
> * The second is the column you want to convert your data frame wide by. The values of that column will become column headers.
> * The third is the values that will populate the cells in your new columns.

## Reshaping data frames

`pivot_wider()` converts a data frame from long to wide:

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
pivot_wider(districts_long, names_from = 'system_name', 
            values_from = 'value')
```

## Exercise 11

Reshape the `tvaas` data frame long by subject, then arrange by system.

``` {r}
tvaas %>%
    pivot_longer(`TVAAS Composite`:`TVAAS Numeracy`, 
                 names_to = 'subject', values_to = 'score') %>%
    arrange(system)
```
